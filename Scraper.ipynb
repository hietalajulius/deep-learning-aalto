In our case we’re dealing with the sum, that’s why dot products and other matrix operations can be used to get the correct shapes and results. That goes for db as well. Since for each individual batch the derivative of b wrt to the input is just a vector of ones and the resulting batch gradient is a product 1*dy, you can think of the final gradient db as of sum of individual gradients over the batches. Having that in mind, find out how to get this sum with the resulting shape (ysize,) out of the initial (batch_size, ysize) shape \n",

Is there a way to calculate dW without dy or x, or should I use some average value of dy and x to calculate dW?
