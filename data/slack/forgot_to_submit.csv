@channel I need your permission to copy your files. Please send me a private message that it is ok to copy your files of the first assignment.
@channel those who gave me permission to copy the files and whose last modified date was before the deadline should now see the feedback in their folders.
Didn't receive feedback but jupyter shows submitted. What could be wrong? Thanks. starckv1
