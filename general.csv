"""The problem related to the fact that the decoder may produce sequences longer than the target sequence when teacher_forcing=False has been fixed in the updated assignment."" => Would it be possible to know where and how the fix was made, so that we can just incorporate in current copy (if it is trivial), instead of downloading the whole assignment again. (edited) "
"(from a research perspective, the latter seems less error prone, especially if we dont intend on changing the approach we’re comparing against)"
"@Alexander Ilin Can you please describe the SMB thing in detail, maybe with an working example, for windows?"
@Alexander Ilin What's the maximum number of people allowed for a project team? Is it 3 or 2? It used to say 3 on mycourses and we already formed a team...
"Ah.. in ""For Aalto Users"" section."
"Also, if I understood correctly, the Block has changed calculation should be continuous regardless of groups? In other words, the Block does not care about the groups, only about the definition of the previously defined block? (edited) "
"Anyone else having trouble getting conda to work? I'm just getting a ""SpecNotFound: Can't process without a name"" error whatever I try."
Are there any other possibilities to take the exam than on May 31st as stated in oodi? Thanks!
Are there limitations to the format of the project? E.g. should it be jupyter notebook with comments or can it also be plain python & markdown documentation?
"As for the project, I have a question about the evaluation. If the evaluation is going to be peergrading, how will the ""peergraders"" evaluate the novelty/excellency of the approach? Is this bonus associated only with the report itself or should the peergraders familiarize with the state-of-the-art of the each approach to the point of deciding what is novel or excellent?"
"Based on the points assigned in 1st lecture, could a TA please explain how they relate to the grading of the course. For instance, the exercises come out to be total 61 pts, the project 18-20 (?) and the exam, 18. Does this mean they should total to 100 pts for final evaluation of grades? It would be nice to also know how the points are split for grade range 1-5 (not sure I saw it in the slides)."
"Brilliant, we'll come up with a game plan :+1: Thanks!"
"By ""elementwise"" I mean that you apply the same function (with 1-dimensional input and 1-dimensional output) to every element of the input vector."
Can I see my grading from somewhere before DL. It would be good to know if I have done some silly mistake. I didn't find anyone to ask this question in Slack earlier.
Can we use the @ syntax for matrix multiplication? Is the Python version of grader new enough? (edited) 
"Do we have any news with the situation of the examination? A lot of people are having problems with it, including me, and we need to make our schedule, book tickets, do legal documents, etc. Will it be possible to sit the exam earlier?"
Do you have any estimate when we can expect feedback on the 3_reg assignment?
"FOR NEW STUDENTS JOINING THIS WORKSPACE, THERE ARE SEPARATE PUBLIC CHANNELS FOR EACH ASSIGNMENT, PLEASE DIRECT THE DISCUSSION TO THE APPROPRIATE CHANNEL ( by clicking on Channels , you can browse and join all other channels)"
"Fixed to 18.04, thanks."
"For me at least ""activation_fn (callable): An element-wise function used in every layer except in the last one."" wasn't that clear when I was doing the exercises. I did finally figure it out though."
"From the assignments page: ""You can submit multiple times. Only the last submission will be evaluated.""

Can we not get the points from the last submission that was on time? I did not realize that the grader will automatically give zero points if the last submission is late (or that it would even be possible to make a submission too late) even though there were earlier valid submissions. It would sound very harsh that you can lose all your earlier points from for example assignment 5.1 by making an additional submission with updated assignment 5.2 one minute too late."
"General question(s): Talking about image classification, when does it make sense to use a pretrained model? How close does the data the model has been trained on need to be to the data you want to use it for?
Eg would it make sense to use a model pretrained on face image data for your datasets of cats and dogs? Or using a model pretrained on imagenet (or similar, that has some classes like airplanes and ships etc that are similar, though probably from a different angle) for high resolution satellite image classification? Or a model pretrained on high resolution (0.2m spatial res) for low resolution (10-30m spatial resolution) satellite data? And related to that: How about image datasets having different spectral resolutions (number of channels)?
Is it better to have a model trained on more detailed/various dataset or better to have one trained on more basic dataset?"
Go to Files and you should see the data files there. It says “empty” because this is not a real assignment and it does contain notebooks.
Have lecture slides been uploaded to somewhere?
"Hello, I think it would be beneficial if we could run the feedback points 3-7 times before submitting the work. It is confusing that there are tests to assess the size of the network and that even thus they are valid the answer is assess as completely incorrect by the feedback. I mean, the feedback does not scaled the points to the effort. It is or completely correct or completely incorrect. Therefore, it would be nice to have a way to run the automated checking our-self and get an idea of what is consider correct!"
"Hello, concerning @Alexander Ilin’s MyCourses message today (On cloning notebooks): does this mean that we can not, after all, solve the notebooks locally on our own computers? I.e. we can not download the notebooks, solve them, and then upload them to jupterhub? So we have to solve them locally and then find each cell we have modified and then manually copy them into the cells in the original notebook on jupyterhub?"
"Hey! I find out that in first assignment and in section ""Train an MLP network"" => ""Training loop"" says that we used Adam optimizer with learning rate = 0.01 and but my optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(mlp.parameters(), lr=0.005)? So which learning rate is the correct one, 0.005 or 0.01? (edited) "
"Hey, why does the solution for ""A multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with two hidden layers"" uses sequential, but the exercise itself says ""Please do not use torch.nn.Sequential in your code.""?"
"Hi Jan, you will get feedback today."
Hi how long do the feedback for proposal take? Do we have to get approval before ddl?
"Hi our team uploaded a project proposal on Monday (submitted by Gabriele Salvo). I would appreciate if I can get feedback soon, since tmr is ddl and if there is sth need more details, we can amend before ddl. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks"
Hi! I forgot to set skip_training to True before submission can I update it before getting feedback? Thank you!
"Hi! I was trying to re-fetch the assignment 5, but the directory 5_rnn cannot be deleted! I first made it empty, but still I get the error: ""Delete Failed"" .
Anyone can help? Is it possible that there is a hidden file? How can I delete it?"
"Hi,
I am having difficulty in understanding the first task of resNet. what should be the output channel of the first convolutional layer. Or is it the convolutional layer channel do not change?"
"Hi, I fetched 31_regularization some days ago and I finished and validated it. As I did not submit it, I wanted to validate it now and submit it but it's not validating anymore...I presume it could br related to the updates you made? Anyhow, I was trying to refetch it but I haven't been able to figure out how. Could you give further instructions on how to ""refetch"" this?

Thanks!"
"Hi, I made a new project proposal. I would appreciate if I can get feedback on it (the previous version was graded on Friday 5th by Kunal Ghosh, so even if it says graded pls check the date) (edited) "
"Hi, I submitted my 2nd iteration for the project proposal, would appreciate very much if I can get feedback on it so that I can re-iterate my project topic during the weekend if it fails again :see_no_evil:"
"Hi, how long is 32_hyperparameters_search supposed to run? With 10000 hyperparameter combinations, it's still running for several hours now (on CPU). Just wondering if that's expected for the assignment to take this long in a single run. (edited) "
"Hi, it seems there are some discussions about exam. Could someone please share the current date/time of exam? At least, I could not find it from course site, and the one in oodi says ""Canceled"" :slightly_smiling_face:."
"Hi, where is the problem mentioned in last message available in slack? At least, the link in the message did not lead to anywhere in slack (when opened with browser). (edited) "
"Hi.
I wanted to ask question regarding the submission. While submitting should there be a separate submission of the file 1_mlp.pth. Because when submitting I can only see the jupyter notebook file.
Moreover, should there be any submission regarding the data folder which has an empty jupyter notebook."
Hi. Are we going to have lectures or are we over with them?
How do I submit the 3_random_search.npz and 3_mlp.pth files? Are they included automatically or do I need to include them somehow?
How long is validation for 31 supposed to run? It's been going at it for quite a while...
"I accidentally completely missed the Assignment 1 (I didn't even download the assignment). Does that mean that I've failed the course, since according to the Introduction slides, I ""need to do six assignments""?"
"I can run the code 31 and 32 smoothly and get the desired results. However in validation step,  the result is : Error validating assignment. Dose anyone know what is wrong?"
I can't seem to get same answers for the analytical and numerical gradients for the ReLU.
I expect most of the projects to have zero bonus points but still hope that a few will get some.
"I have a hard time figuring out the deadlines for the exercises, i.e. I can't find the DL on assignment 3 right now. Where can I find it?"
I have a question regarding the project. We can do it in a team of maximum three people. Does it mean that it is a suggested number of people in the group? Or is it fine to do it in pair/alone?
I have fixed the error message. No need to re-fetch the assignment. Those who would fetch the assignment now should see the fixed error message. (edited) 
"I have problem with my feedback.
The issue is that I have submitted both files 31_regularization and 32_hyperparameter_search. The feedback for 31_regularization normal, but for 32_hyperparameter_search.html I got 0.
It looks like your grading script has run on the old version of my 32_hyperparameter_search, thus gave me 0. I just run my file again and it seems to work perfectly fine. How can I resolve it? (edited) "
I inserted the input command to prevent overwriting a trained model if you validate your notebook and forgot to set skip_training=True (edited) 
"I missed the starting lecture so two questions regarding assignments. There is no minimum point requirement from an assignment round, e.g. you can pass the course even if you miss a round? Are the model answers available after the dl of an assignment round? Thanks!"
"I ran this week's exercises on the Paniikki computers, but the pytorch version that came with module load anaconda3/latest was old (0.3.0, so it didn't support torch.device), so I had to install the 4GB Conda environment. Could it be possible to upgrade pytorch in Paniikki? I could also post a ticket to Aalto-IT, but I figure it gets handled a bit faster if the course staff ask for it."
I submitted the exercise 5 yesterday. Then i submitted it again because a made some modifications and the deadline was extended. Presumably only the latest submission is graded?
"I think the mycourses instruction might be incorrect, it says:
- Upload the notebook and the files created during training ...
- Run all the cells again with skip_training=False on jupyterhub.
but I assume we're not supposed to run the training on JH."
I try to download the data and exercise 1 by using \\jhnas.org.aalto.fi\knuutto1 as a network drive. It asks a username and password but my general aalto credentials don't work. There's no additional information at http://scicomp.aalto.fi/aalto/jupyterhub-data.html  It's painful to create each folder and download each file manually from jupyter.cs.aalto.fi. Am I missing something? How should this be done?
I used tar -cvf  data.tar data_folder and then downloaded the tar file
I would like to ask about approving the project topic. How does that happen and when? I would like to start working on it soon but I also want to wait for the approval first.
I've realized that I've described in my project proposal a method that's unnecessarily complicated. Can I update the proposal immediately or should I wait for it to be reviewed once?
"If I want to go to a Q&A session to discuss the grading of my assignment but cannot attend the session on Friday because of something I have planned before the course started, what can I do?"
"Implementation of grid_search() and random_search() instructs:
Returns an iterator over all combinations of the grid values of the given iterables.
(edited)"
In jupyter.cs.aalto.fi click on the files tab and choose assignment 6 you can download it from there
In the first lecture I said that one has to return all the assignments and the minimum number of points to pass the course will be decided based on the histogram of points (as it is difficult to assess the difficulty of the assignments). Let me make the rule less strict: you do not have to return all the assignments but you will not get points for the ones that you did not return.
"Is it possible to have the lecture slides uploaded to MyCourses before the lecture? At least I have time to check the slides out before the lecture, and would appreciate the possibility to do so."
Is it possible to see the grading points after submission?
Is the feedback from exercise 1 already somewhere or will it become available later?
Is there a faster way to download the data from jupyterhub than opening every single one and “File - Download”?
Is there a way to fetch the assingment 4 anymore? I did not fetch it originally and missed the deadline but I would still like to check the code.
Is this a correct due date?
It is a suggested number. You can do it alone or in a pair. I might actually limit the max number to two.
It is described in the instructions
It would be nice if the course staff could be easily identified here on Slack. At least on the Programming Parallel Computers course the staff have their nicks in the form @somename-staff
"May I ask where can I find the file""visualizations.py""?"
"Morning Professor @Alexander Ilin, I was told to re-fetch the assignment since the validation failed. I can't see the option to re-fetch. I tried to delete the whole folder but wasn't able either (some files was deleted but not all. I have downloaded the notebook just in case). Do you know how should I proceed?"
No exceptions?
"Okay, thank you. And just to be sure, the deadline of the Assignment 2 is on Monday 23:59?"
Or the term elementwise function wasn't that familiar
Please set skip_training to True before validation. The error actually says the opposite. My bad.
Questions related to project? new channel? (edited) 
"Regarding moving files between JH and local computer, you can use the Jupyterhub terminal to compress (tar) the directories, then you can simply download the archive"
"Regarding the comment on implementing things from scratch at todays lecture: Assignment 2 handled most of my itch for bare bones implementation, but it didn't cover convolutions. These would've been a nice addition as they're a crucial component of many of the methods covered (maybe as a small first exercise in the 4th assignment, to not interrupt the flow of the course?)"
"Regarding the project grading criteria, how can a 1 point question have e.g. 3 ""quality levels""? For example 1.3 Data description (1 point) has as answers A. ""The data is not described well"", B. ""...some details are missing"", C. ""...described well"". If A is 0 points and C is 1 point, what is B? Are there half points?"
"Regarding the project, are we allowed to use pretrained networks (like resnet) in training, or should the model be built from scratch?"
"Related to question above, is there a minimum amout of points from assignments that are required to pass the course?"
"Round 4, ResNET:

The only way I figured out how to track the change of the blocks was to use class variables, however, this means that if the definition block is not run again between some of the test sells, the first block in the group test will be counted as changed. If the Block defining cell is ran again before the group test the first block of the first group will be correct.


Will the grader accept this kind of solution? The test cells cannot be edited so I cannot reset the class variable programmatically within the notebook."
"Round 4: There is quite a lot of repeated elements for the VGG style network, how will the grader handle if I construct the network with layers in side of nn.Sequential and nn.Sequential(nn.Sequential) structures or do we need to define the layers individually for the grader to be able to evaluate the solution?"
Same for our group (submitted by Emmi Rehn)
Se above post :point_up:
"The assignment tab shows only ipynb files. When you click ""Submit"" all the files from the folder are submitted."
The evaluation form for the project talks about “conference” grade work in multiple assessment criteria. Could this be clarified more. If someone is able to create “novel/original” conference level work in a few weeks why would one be taking an introductory course in deep learning? Sounds like late stage PhD level requirements.
"These are bonus points that I wanted to give to exceptional projects. In order to pass the course with the highest grade, you do not have to collect any bonus points."
Tuesday 6AM
Wait a sec. Why can't I see the assignment 2 anymore? It is missing from the list.
"We submitted a project proposal for a 3-person team, when can we expect to have it approved/declined, in case we have to rearrange the team?"
"What will the exam be like? Is there (pseudo)programming, concepts, theory? How many exercises? How many points per exercise?"
"When I fetch 'data' and click on it, it says empty. I can't seem to download the data."
"When I log in to jupyter.cs.aalto.fi it defaults to a jupyter lab view (https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi/user/username/lab). I found out that I could get the old view back by replacing lab with tree, but then when looking at the assignments tab I see this"
"When I try to save my notebooks or even delete files on JupyterHub, I get this error [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded . I didn't submit the data folder and I don't have huge files uploaded or something. The only ""weird"" thing I did is to validate my notebook without turning the skip_training to True by mistake, but I've done that again in the past."
"When validating the exercise it gives the below error. This is probably related to the fact that the validator cannot handle yes/no confirmation, is this excpected behavior?

Would it be possible to create separate channels for each assignment?
"Would it be possible to record the lectures? It would be an immense help, and T1 lecture hall has it set up to be basically a 1-click solution for the lecturer."
Would it be possible to resubmit assignments once the deadline is passed (similar to Bayesian Data Analysis course)?
"You are right, you should set skip_training=True during validation. Thanks!"
You do not have to re-implement the baseline methods. You can also just report numbers from the literature (if you use a standard benchmark) without running the code of the comparison method.
"did that too, but it didn't help"
hello. is it possible to work on the mini-project on my own?
"hi, the rest of the course will be for the project only, right? no more lecture and assignment, I assume?"
