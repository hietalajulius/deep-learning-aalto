@channel those who gave me permission to copy the files and whose last modified date was before the deadline should now see the feedback in their folders.
"Ah, I considered it to be 5 March 6 pm, like one guy asked on 3 March. :face_palm: Confusing..."
Didn't receive feedback but jupyter shows submitted. What could be wrong? Thanks. starckv1
Doesn't look like anything's happened in my folder. :thinking_face:
"If I remember correctly you do not have an aalto email. This might be related to that, I need to figure it out. By the way, where do you see that it is submitted?"
Not sure if I should have a submit button for the first assignment
